## 100 numpy exercises

This is a fork of [Rougier's Numpy-100](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100) exercises.  

This repo is an attempt to git gud and refresh my knowledge of numpy.

It was also mentioned here: [A Barebones Guide to Mechanistic Interpretability Prerequisites](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/prereqs).

I think Mechanistic Interpretability is a nice field to get into and it might be useful for my own research. Hence, this repo.  

I might make a blog post out of this / use it for interview prep.

My attempts at solving are in:
